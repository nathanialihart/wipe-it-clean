# wipe-it-clean


A simple python script that uninstalls preinstalled slop on Windows PC's such as: microsoft edge, microsoft store, microsoft cortana, xbox, weather, camera, news, onedrive, people, etc. Also disables telemtry and more. the process will take about 30+ minutes to complete.
# DISCLAMER
THIS CAN *BREAK* WINDOWS UPDATES AND DEFENDER PERMANENTLY. DO NOT RUN ON YOUR PRIMARY PC 
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE BY THIS SOFTWARE. YOU CHOOSE TO RUN IT, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.
# rollback
there is also a rollback as well and a boot repair i put in there to obviously fix the damage done. you'll still have to reinstall the uwp apps though.
